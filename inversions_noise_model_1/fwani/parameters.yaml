# .. rubric::
#   - Determine available options for modules by running:
#       > seisflows print modules
#   - Auto-fill with docstrings and default values (recommended) by running:
#       > seisflows configure
#   - Swap out module parameters for a configured parameter file by running:
#       > seisflows swap {module} {name} (e.g., seisflows swap solver specfem3d)
#   - To set values as NoneType, use: null

#    Forward Workflow
#    ----------------

#    is in charge of running forward solver in parallel and (optionally) 
#    calculating data-synthetic misfit and adjoint sources.
#
#    Parameters
#    ----------
#    :type modules: list of module
#    :param modules: instantiated SeisFlows modules which should have been

#        `path_data/{source_name}` in the same format that the solver will
#        produce synthetics (controlled by `solver.format`) OR
#        synthetic': 'data' will be generated as synthetic seismograms using
#        a target model provided in `path_model_true`. If None, workflow will
#        not attempt to generate data.

#        intermediate results or debug.
#    :type export_traces: bool
#    :param export_traces: export all waveforms that are generated by the
#        external solver to `path_output`. If False, solver traces stored in

#    :type export_residuals: bool
#    :param export_residuals: export all residuals (data-synthetic misfit) that
#        are generated by the external solver to `path_output`. If False,

#
#        
#    Migration Workflow
#    ------------------
#    Run forward and adjoint solver to produce event-dependent misfit kernels.

#    :type export_gradient: bool
#    :param export_gradient: export the gradient after it has been generated

#        been generated in the scratch directory. If False, gradient can be

#    :type thrifty: bool
#    :param thrifty: a thrifty inversion skips the costly intialization step
#        (i.e., forward simulations and misfit quantification) if the final
#        forward simulations from the previous iterations line search can be
#        used in the current one. Requires L-BFGS optimization.
#    :type export_model: bool
#    :param export_model: export best-fitting model from the line search to disk.
