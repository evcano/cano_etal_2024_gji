# The impact of noise sources in subsurface models

This repository includes scripts used in E.V. Cano, A. Fichtner, D.B. Peter, and P.M. Mai, The impact of ambient noise sources in subsurface models estimated from noise correlation waveforms (accepted for publication in Geophysical Journal International, 2024).

Seismic wave simulations were carried out using SPECFEM2D, version 8.0.0, development branch:

- https://github.com/SPECFEM/specfem2d/tree/38577754c8166b27f18fdf54ee725a6ac72f9030

Seismic inversions were performed using a modified version of SeisFlows:
